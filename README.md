library-boilerplate
=========================

An opinionated setup I plan to use for my libraries.

It has CommonJS and UMD builds via Babel and Webpack, ESLint, and Mocha.  
It also has React-friendly examples folder with library code mapped to the sources.

If you use this, make sure to grep for “library-boilerplate” and replace every occurrence.  
See `package.json` in the root and the example folder for available commands.
